/*
Write a program that prompts the user to enter some number of pennies (1-cent coins), nickels(5-cent coins), dimes(10-cent coins), quarters(25-cent coins, half dollars(50-cent coins), and one-dollar coins(100-cent coins). Query the user separately for the number of each size coin, e.g., "How many pennies do you have?" Then your program should print out something like this:

You have 23 pennies.
You have 17 nickels.
You have 14 dimes.
You have 7 quarters.
You have 3 half dollars.
The value of all of your coins is 573 cents.

Make some improvements: if only one of a coin is reported, make the output grammatically correct, eg., 14 dimes, and 1 dime(not 1  dimes). Also report the sum in dollars and cents, ie,. $5.73 instead of 573 cents.
