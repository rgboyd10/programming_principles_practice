Write a description of how to get from the front door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, to the door of your classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are not, pick another target).  Have a friend try to follow the instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes along.  To keep friends, it may be a good idea to "field test" those instruction before giving them to a friend.
