/*
Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result.  For example:
+100 3.15
* 4 5

Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example if(operation == "+"). Read the operands into variables of type double. implement this for operations called +, -, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.

  //request the operator and operands from the user and read them into the variables


  //calculate the result and store it in a variable


  //output the result
