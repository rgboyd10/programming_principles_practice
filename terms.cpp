/*
  Write a definition for each of the terms from "Terms". First try to see if you can do it without looking at the chapter (not likely), then look through the chapter to find definitions. You might find the difference between your first attempt and the books's version interesting.  You might consult some suitable online glossary, such as www.stroustrup.com/glossary.html. By writing your own definition before looking it up, you reinforce the learning you achiever through your reading.  If you have reread a section to form a definition, that just helps you to understand.  Feel free to use your own words for the definitions, and make the definitions as detailed as you think reasonable.  Often, an example after the main definition will be helpful.  You may like to store the definitions in a file so that you can add to them from the "Terms" sections of later chapters.
